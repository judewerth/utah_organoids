# Running the Workflow Computations on the Cloud

The cloud environment is pre-configured, and the primary task here is to upload the data on the cloud:

1. **Create a New Session**: Specify the session and upload the raw data to the cloud.
    + Follow the [CLOUD_UPLOAD_CONFIGURATION_INSTRUCTIONS](CLOUD_UPLOAD_CONFIGURATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md) to create a new session and upload the data.

2. **Execution**: Once the session is created, computations are automatically executed on the cloud, eliminating the need for manual population. This automation covers most computational tasks associated with the session.
