# Running the Pipeline on the Cloud

## Steps

The cloud environment is pre-configured, and the primary task here is to upload the data on the cloud:

1. Upload data: Follow [CLOUD_UPLOAD_CONFIGURATION](../installation_and_configuration/CLOUD_UPLOAD_CONFIGURATION.md) for data upload.
2. Run computations: Cloud computations execute automatically upon session creation, eliminating the need for manual population. This automation covers most computational tasks associated with the session.
3. Results will be available to explore through the `EXPLORE` notebooks.
