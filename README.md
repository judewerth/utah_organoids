    ```
1. Create conda virtual environment
    ```bash
    conda env create -f env.yml --force && conda activate utah_organoids
    ```
1. Install dependencies
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```
1. To create the `dj_local_conf.json` file, execute the command below. Input your username and password when prompted:

    ```
1. Insert the AWS functional user credentials to fetch data from the s3 bucket to the notebook:
    + By inserting the credentials in the `dj_local_conf.json` file
    + By creating a `.env` file containing these credentials as environment variables


## Uploading Raw Data
Please follow these steps to upload your raw data files:

1. Configure `config.yaml` file
    1. Run the following to locate `config.yaml` file
        ```
        djsciops config
        ```
    2. Update the following values
        1. `account_id`
        4. `client_id`
        5. `issuer`
        6. `bucket`
        7. `role`
        8. `local_outbox`


1. On Windows, open the command prompt application by searching for the following:
    ```
    Anaconda Prompt (miniconda3)
    ```

1. Activate the conda environment by typing the following in the command prompt:
    ```bash
    conda activate utah_organoids
    ```

1. Open a python interpreter by typing the following in the command prompt:
    ```bash
    ipython
    ```

1. Change directories to where the raw data is stored
    ```python
    cd "D:\"
    ```

1. Run data upload for a single subject and a single recording session.
    ```python
    from workflow import upload_session_data
    upload_session_data('<Relative path of data>')
    ```
