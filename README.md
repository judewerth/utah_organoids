# DataJoint Workflow for Utah Lab

This is the central codebase for the **DataJoint Workflow for Utah Lab**. The pipelines are designed to manage and analyze data from the Utah lab, focusing on cerebral organoids characterization and electrophysiology data analysis.

The automated pipeline consists of several schemas and tables, covering multiple data modalities and/or DataJoint Elements.

- **Organoids generation pipeline**: The protocol for organoid generation includes inducing pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to form single neural rosettes (SNRs), which are then developed into organoids.

This pipeline manages data from the organoid generation process, including iPSCs, SNRs, and organoids. It includes the following schemas:
  - `lineage`: Handles lineage and sequence metadata.
  - `culture`: Manages metadata for iPSCs, SNRs, and organoids, covering culture conditions, induction and post-induction details, media used, experiment timelines and directories, and drug concentrations.

- **Array Ephys pipeline**: This pipeline for array electrophysiology data analysis includes the following main steps:
  - `probe`: Manages the probes and metadata used for the electrophysiology recordings.
  - `ephys`: Manages the electrophysiology data and analysis results, including spike sorting and quality metrics.
    - `EphysRecording`: Represents raw electrophysiological recordings linked to specific probe insertions. `EphysRecordingFile`: Represents the raw data files associated with each recording.
    - `Preprocessing`: Applies preprocessing steps like filtering and artifact removal to raw data.
    - `Clustering`: Stores the spike sorting results.
    - `Curation`: Facilitates manual or automated curation of sorted spike data.
    - `QualityMetrics`: Calculates and stores quality metrics after the spike sorting.
    - `Unit`: Final output of curated, high-quality single-unit data.

## Summary on Getting Started with Works App

- _Goal_: **Explore the current pipeline architecture and results** without running new data or new analyses, and with no installation required.

- _Steps_:
  1. Request access to a DataJoint account:
     1. Request a new account from your DataJoint support team.
     2. Once approved, you will receive your DataJoint credentials (username and password) to access:
     - DataJoint platform
     - Organoids SciViz website
     - Database connection  
  2. Log onto the [DataJoint platform](https://works.datajoint.com/) (no installation required).
  3. In the `Notebooks` tab, run the notebooks located under `utah_organoids/notebooks/`.
        - `EXPLORE` notebooks: Explore the current pipeline architecture and results. Please run the `EXPLORE_pipeline_architecture.ipynb` to examine the main schemas of the pipeline.
        - `CREATE` notebooks allow creating new experiments, parameter sets, and sessions. For example, `CREATE_new_clustering_paramset.ipynb` to create a new clustering parameter set for `spykingcircus2`.
